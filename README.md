# Standard operational transform types

We have a lovely buffet of operational transform types. Each type has many fine
features, including thorough testing, browser support and documentation. Each
type has its own project in this github organization.

These types have been finely aged in
[ShareJS](https://github.com/josephg/sharejs)'s type labs, and now they're
ready to enter the world and be used by everyone. We are rather proud of them.

Each type defines a set of standard methods for programatic use. You should be
able to define a type using the spec then plug it directly into ShareJS (or
other compatible collaborative editing systems) and use it immediately. The
type defines how operations and documents are stored and manipulated, while a
system like sharejs can decide where the data should be stored on disk, network
protocols and all that jazz.

## Available OT types

This repository contained three OT types. They were split to separate repositories:

### [ot-text-unicode](https://github.com/ottypes/text-unicode)

This is the type you should use for normal plain-text editing. It can tranform operation with complexity N against operation with complexity M in O(N+M) time. This makes it much faster than ot-text-tp2 implementation.

### [ot-text-tp2](https://github.com/ottypes/text)

This implementation features [Transform Property 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation#Convergence_properties) which makes it a good suit for peer-to-peer communication. Unfortunately the extra (unnecessary) complexity kills v8's optimizer and as a result ot-text-tp2 goes about 20x slower than the ot-text type. If you're using client-server library like ShareJS, you don't need TP2 property, so you should use simpler ot-text implementation,

### [ot-json1](https://github.com/ottypes/json1)

This implementation is capable of transforming not only text but also JSON structures. It supports arbitrary inserts, deletes, and reparenting through the tree of a JSON object.

### [rich-text](https://github.com/ottypes/rich-text)

This is an OT implementation for collaboratively editing rich text documents. It was designed alongside [QuillJS](http://quilljs.com/) for editing those documents.

## Javascript Spec

Each OT type exposes a single object with the following properties. Note that
only *name*, *create*, *apply* and *transform* are strictly required, though
most types should also include *url* and *compose*.

There is a simple example of a working type in [example.js](example.js). For a
more thorough example, take a look at [the text type](/ottypes/text).

If you're publishing your library in npm (and you should!), the module should
expose an object with a `.type` property (containing your type). So for
example, `require('ot-text').type.name` contains the text type's name.

### Standard properties

- **name**: A user-readable name for the type. This is not guaranteed to be unique.
- **uri**: *(Optional, will be required soon)* A canonical location for this type. The spec for the OT type should be at this address. Remember kids, Tim Berners-Lee says [cool URLs don't change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html).
- **create([initialData]) -> snapshot**: A function to create the initial document snapshot. Create may accept initial snapshot data as its only argument. Either the return value must be a valid target for `JSON.stringify` or you must specify *serialize* and *deserialize* functions (described below).
- **apply(snapshot, op) -> snapshot'**: Apply an operation to a document snapshot. Returns the changed snapshot. For performance, old document must not be used after this function call, so apply may reuse and return the current snapshot object.
- **transform(op1, op2, side) -> op1'**: Transform op1 by op2. Return the new op1. In other words, make op1 compatible with a document where op2 has already been applied.
  
  Side is either `'left'` or `'right'`. It exists to break ties, for example if two operations insert at the same position in a string, or write to the same property in an object. `'left'` means that op1 (the left argument) should take priority in a tie, and vice versa.
  
  Both op1 and op2 must not be modified by transform. Transform must conform to Transform Property 1. That is:
  
  ```
  apply(apply(snapshot, op1), transform(op2, op1, 'left')) == apply(apply(snapshot, op2), transform(op1, op2, 'right')).
  ```
  
- **compose(op1, op2) -> op**: *(optional)* Compose op1 and op2 to produce a new operation. The new operation must subsume the behaviour of op1 and op2. Specifically, apply(apply(snapshot, op1), op2) == apply(snapshot, compose(op1, op2)). Note: transforming by a composed operation is *NOT* guaranteed to produce the same result as transforming by each operation in order. This function is optional, but unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, you should provide a compose function for your type.

### Optional properties

- **invertWithDoc(op, doc) -> op'**: *(optional, RECOMMENDED)* Invert the given operation using context from the document to which it can be applied. This method should generally be added to every type as a way to create undo operations. Formally given apply(snapshot, op) is valid, this creates an operation such that apply(apply(snapshot, op), invert(op, snapshot)) == snapshot. If invert(op) exists, invertWithDoc(op, \_) == invert(op). *ðŸ’£ NOTE*: The document passed to invertWithDoc should be the document state *before* the operation is applied. Not *after* the operation has been applied.
- **invert(op) -> op'**: *(optional)* Invert the given operation. The original operation must not be edited in the process. If supplied, apply(apply(snapshot, op), invert(op)) == snapshot.
- **normalize(op) -> op'**: *(optional)* Normalize an operation, converting it to a canonical representation. normalize(normalize(op)) == normalize(op).
- **transformCursor(cursor, op, isOwnOp) -> cursor'**: *(optional)* transform the specified cursor by the provided operation, so that the cursor moves forward or backward as content is added or removed before (or at) the cursor position. isOwnOp defines how the cursor should be transformed against content inserted *at* the cursor position. If isOwnOp is true, the cursor is moved after the content inserted at the original cursor position. If isOwnOp is false, the cursor remains before the content inserted at the original cursor position.
- **serialize(snapshot) -> data**: *(optional)* convert the document snapshot data into a form that may be passed to JSON.stringify. If you have a *serialize* function, you must have a *deserialize* function.
- **deserialize(data) -> snapshot**: *(optional)* convert data generated by *serialize* back into its internal snapshot format. deserialize(serialize(snapshot)) == snapshot. If you have a *deserialize* function, you must have a *serialize* function.

> Do I need serialize and deserialize? Maybe JSON.stringify is sufficiently customizable..?

### TP2 Properties

If your OT type supports [transform property 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation#Convergence_properties), set the *tp2* property to true and define a *prune* function.

Transform property 2 is an additional requirement on your *transform* function. Specifically, transform(op3, compose(op1, transform(op2, op1)) == transform(op3, compose(op2, transform(op1, op2)).

- **tp2**: *(optional)* Boolean property. Make this truthy to declare that the type has tp2 support. Types with TP2 support must define *prune*.
- **prune(op, otherOp)**: The inverse of transform. Formally, apply(snapshot, op1) == apply(snapshot, prune(transform(op1, op2), op2)). Usually, prune will simply be the inverse of transform and prune(transform(op1, op2), op2) == op1.

### CRDTs

Technically, CRDT types are a subset of OT types. Which is to say, they *are*
OT types that don't need a transform function. As a result, anything that can
handle these OT types should also be able to consume CRDTs. But I haven't
tested it. If anyone wants to work with me to add CRDT support here, [email
me](mailto:josephg.com).
